Here is a simple example of how to use the _NgOptimizedImage_ directive.
The _NgOptimizedImage_ directive makes it easy to adopt performance best practices for loading images.

### Import NgOptimizedImage

```typescript
import { NgOptimizedImage } from "@angular/common";
```

### Enable the directive

To enable the NgOptimizedImage directive, replace your image's src attribute with _ngSrc_ and to prevent image related layout shifts,
NgOptimizedImage requires that you specify a height and width for the image

```html
<img ngSrc="image.jpg" width="300" height="200" />
```

And if you don't know the size of the images, you can use the _fill_ attribute to inherit the size of the parent container.
For the "fill" image to render properly, its parent element must be styled with
`position: "relative", position: "fixed", or position: "absolute".`

```html
<img ngSrc="image.jpg" fill />
```
